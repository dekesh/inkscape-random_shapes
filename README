Inkscaoe plugin to place pictures at random places and orientation
in page. Works for inkscape 0.92 (and below?). 

Should be placed under the inkscape extensions folder. In linux:

~/.config/inkscape/extensions/random_shapes.py
~/.config/inkscape/extensions/random_shapes.inx

After installation should appear under 
Extensions->Arrange->random shapes filler.

Usuage:
Import all the pictures of interest into inkscape layer, and run the extension
to replicate the pictures in a non-overlapping way.
